## What is Performance Testing?
__Ans:__  
- Performance testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the speed, responsiveness, stability, and overall performance of a system under a specific workload.
- The goal is to identify and address performance bottlenecks, ensure that the application meets performance requirements, and deliver a satisfactory user experience.
- Performance testing is crucial for applications and systems to function effectively, especially in scenarios where multiple users are accessing the system simultaneously.
- Performance testing involves simulating real-world usage scenarios and assessing how well the system performs under different conditions.
- This type of testing helps in understanding the behavior of the application under varying loads, identifying performance-related issues, and optimizing the system to meet performance expectations.

## Types of Performance Testing:
__Load Testing:__   
-  Measures the system's ability to handle increasing loads, helping identify the maximum operating capacity.   
-  Load testing involves applying a load to the system to evaluate its response under normal and peak conditions.   
-  _Objective:_ Determine the system's capacity to handle a specific number of users or transactions and identify performance issues under expected loads.   

__Stress Testing:__
-  Evaluates how the system behaves under extreme conditions, pushing it beyond normal or peak load.
-  Stress testing involves subjecting the system to conditions that exceed normal or peak loads to assess its behavior under extreme situations.
-  _Objective:_ Identify the breaking point or limitations of the system and understand how it behaves under stress. 

__Volume Testing:__  
-  Assesses the system's ability to handle a large amount of data.
-  Volume testing assesses the system's ability to handle a large amount of data.
- _Objective:_ Ensure that the application can efficiently process and manage data as the volume increases.   

__Scalability Testing:__
-  Determines how well the system scales as user or data volume increases.
-  Scalability testing evaluates the system's ability to scale up or down to handle varying workloads.
-  _Objective:_ Determine how well the system can adapt to changes in user load, transactions, or data volume.
