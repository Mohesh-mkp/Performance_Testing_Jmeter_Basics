## Roles & Responsibility:
The main role of performance testing is to evaluate how a software application performs under various conditions and workloads.    

The primary needs and objectives of performance testing include:  

**Assessing System Responsiveness:**   
_Objective:_ Evaluate the responsiveness of the system by measuring the time it takes to respond to user interactions or requests.   
_Need:_ Ensure that the application meets user expectations for speed and responsiveness.   

**Identifying Bottlenecks:**   
_Objective:_ Identify performance bottlenecks and limitations in the system under different loads.   
_Need:_ Pinpoint areas of the application that may cause slowdowns or failures under heavy usage, allowing for optimization.

**Ensuring Scalability:**   
_Objective:_ Evaluate the system's ability to scale and handle an increasing number of users, transactions, or data volume.   
_Need:_ Assess the scalability of the application to ensure it can accommodate growth in user base and workload.

**Validating System Stability:**   
_Objective:_ Assess the stability and reliability of the system under normal and extreme conditions.   
_Need:_ Ensure that the application remains stable and performs consistently, even under stress or peak loads.

**Setting Performance Benchmarks:**   
_Objective:_ Establish performance benchmarks and criteria to meet performance requirements.   
_Need:_ Define measurable performance goals to ensure that the application meets specified performance standards and user expectations.

**Optimizing Resource Utilization:**   
_Objective:_ Monitor and optimize the utilization of system resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network.   
_Need:_ Ensure efficient use of resources to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain system stability.

**Preventing Performance Degradation:**   
_Objective:_ Detect and address performance degradation over time or with changes to the application.   
_Need:_ Identify and rectify performance issues before they impact the user experience in a production environment.

**Capacity Planning:**   
_Objective:_ Assist in capacity planning by understanding how the system performs under varying workloads.   
_Need:_ Provide insights into the capacity requirements needed to support current and future user loads.

**Risk Mitigation:**   
_Objective:_ Mitigate the risk of performance-related issues in production.   
_Need:_ Identify and resolve performance issues early in the development lifecycle, reducing the likelihood of problems affecting end-users.

**Ensuring Quality User Experience:**   
_Objective:_ Ensure that the application delivers a high-quality and satisfactory user experience.   
_Need:_ Validate that the application performs well under realistic usage scenarios, meeting or exceeding user expectations.

Performance testing is an integral part of the software development process, helping organizations deliver applications that not only meet functional requirements but also provide a responsive and reliable experience for end-users under various conditions.
